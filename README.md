# Matching an Email – /^([a-z0-9_.-]+)@([\da-z.-]+).([a-z.]{2,6})$/
Validating an email address format is a common requirement in programming. This regular expression ensures an email address meets a basic format for a valid email.

## Summary
This regex, /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/, is designed to match an email address. It verifies that an email consists of a username, the "@" symbol, a domain name, and a top-level domain. We’ll break down each part of the expression to understand how it enforces the email structure.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
^ asserts the start of the string.
$ asserts the end of the string.
These anchors ensure that the email is matched as a whole and doesn’t allow extra characters at the beginning or end.

### Quantifiers
+ following each capture group means "one or more" of the preceding character, enforcing that sections of the email cannot be empty.

###OR Operator
The OR operator (|) is not directly used in this regex, as there are no alternative patterns.

### Character Classes
[a-z0-9_\.-] matches lowercase letters, digits, underscores, dots, and hyphens in the username section.
[\da-z\.-] allows digits, letters, dots, and hyphens in the domain name.
[a-z\.] allows lowercase letters and dots in the top-level domain.

### Flags
This regex does not use any flags.

### Grouping and Capturing
() around sections of the pattern create capture groups, dividing the email into:
The username before the "@"
The domain name after the "@"
The top-level domain after the last dot (.).

### Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions like [a-z0-9_\.-] define ranges of allowed characters in the username, domain, and top-level domain parts of the email.

### Greedy and Lazy Match
This regex uses greedy matching by default; + will consume as many characters as possible within each bracketed expression.

### Boundaries
The boundaries of the email are defined by the ^ and $ anchors.

### Back-references
This regex does not use back-references.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
Look-ahead and look-behind assertions are not present in this regex.
